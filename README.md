## :calling: About

A mission control dashboard for managing interstellar space flight missions to "garden" planets flagged as a Kepler Object of Interest(KOIs). An unofficial project in collaboration with NASA and SpaceX, inspired by the [Artemis Program](https://www.nasa.gov/specials/artemis/ 'Artemis Program') and [Mars & Beyond Program](https://www.spacex.com/human-spaceflight/mars/ 'Mars & Beyond').

The application consists of three page sections - Launch, Upcoming & History. The homepage, also known as the application Launch section, is where users can create and schedule their space flight missions to a selection of KOI planets. All confirmed scheduled missions will display in the Upcoming section.

The Upcoming section consists of all upcoming missions scheduled by the user, including any mission data return by the SpaceX API. Users are also able to abort any of the space flight missions in this section by clicking on the :x: logo aligned to the left of each individual mission. Any manually cancelled mission by the user will be automatically flagged as a failed mission.

The History section consists of all past missions starting from the year 2006. Users are able to see all previous mission data and its status in this section. To identify mission status, a color-coded square marker is aligned to the left of each mission indicating their status; green colour for success and red colour for failure.

_**Note: Missions past the current date of viewing the application might still show up in the Upcoming mission list. This is due to the unofficial SpaceX API haven't been updated to reflect the latest & current data**_

This is a full-stack application with its core technologies based on the MERN Stack.

### :question: What is the MERN Stack?

MERN stands for MongoDB, Express, React, Node, after the four key technologies that make up the stack. It is a full-stack, following the traditional 3-tier architectural pattern, including the front-end display tier (React.js), application tier (Express.js and Node.js), and database tier (MongoDB).

- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/1 'MongoDB') - document database
- [Express(.js)](https://expressjs.com/ 'Express') - Node.js web framework
- [React(.js)](https://reactjs.org/ 'React') - a client-side JavaScript framework
- [Node(.js)](https://nodejs.org/en/ 'NodeJS') - the premier JavaScript web server
