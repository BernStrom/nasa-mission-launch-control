## About
A mission control dashboard for launching and managing interstellar space flight missions to "garden" planets flagged as an Kepler Object of Interest(KOIs). An unofficial project in collaboration with NASA and SpaceX, inspired by the Artemis Program.

This will be a full-stack application with its core technologies based on the MERN Stack.

#### What is the MERN Stack?
MERN stands for MongoDB, Express, React, Node, after the four key technologies that make up the stack. It is a full-stack, following the traditional 3-tier architectural pattern, including the front-end display tier (React.js), application tier (Express.js and Node.js), and database tier (MongoDB).

* MongoDB - document database
* Express(.js) - Node.js web framework
* React(.js) - a client-side JavaScript framework
* Node(.js) - the premier JavaScript web server
