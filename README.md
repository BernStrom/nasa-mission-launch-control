## About
A mission control dashboard for launching and managing interstellar space flight missions to "garden" planets flagged as a Kepler Object of Interest(KOIs). An unofficial project in collaboration with NASA and SpaceX, inspired by the [Artemis Program](https://www.nasa.gov/specials/artemis/ "Artemis Program") and [Mars & Beyond Program](https://www.spacex.com/human-spaceflight/mars/ "Mars & Beyond").

This will be a full-stack application with its core technologies based on the MERN Stack.

### What is the MERN Stack?
MERN stands for MongoDB, Express, React, Node, after the four key technologies that make up the stack. It is a full-stack, following the traditional 3-tier architectural pattern, including the front-end display tier (React.js), application tier (Express.js and Node.js), and database tier (MongoDB).

* [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/1 "MongoDB") - document database
* [Express(.js)](https://expressjs.com/ "Express") - Node.js web framework
* [React(.js)](https://reactjs.org/ "React") - a client-side JavaScript framework
* [Node(.js)](https://nodejs.org/en/ "NodeJS") - the premier JavaScript web server
